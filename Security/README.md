# Security Checklist

## 1. Authentication and Authorization:
- [ ] Use strong password policies.
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive accounts.
- [ ] Regularly review and update access control lists (ACLs).
- [ ] Employ role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

## 2. Data Protection:
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest using encryption algorithms.
- [ ] Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- [ ] Implement secure sessions and tokens.
- [ ] Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) in version control.

## 3. Input Validation:
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- [ ] Use parameterized queries for database interactions.
- [ ] Implement input validation on both client and server sides.

## 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:
- [ ] Use anti-CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks.
- [ ] Validate and verify the origin of requests.

## 5. Security Headers:
- [ ] Implement security headers in HTTP responses, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options.
- [ ] Configure proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings.

## 6. Dependency Management:
- [ ] Regularly update and patch all dependencies.
- [ ] Use a software composition analysis tool to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

## 7. Logging and Monitoring:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for security events and anomalies.
- [ ] Regularly review and analyze logs for suspicious activities.
- [ ] Set up alerts for potential security incidents.

## 8. Error Handling:
- [ ] Implement custom error pages to avoid exposing sensitive information.
- [ ] Provide generic error messages to users to avoid data leakage.

## 9. File Uploads:
- [ ] Validate file types and enforce size limits.
- [ ] Store uploaded files in a secure location.
- [ ] Disable execution of uploaded files in server directories.

## 10. Session Management:
- [ ] Use secure, random session identifiers.
- [ ] Implement session timeout and reauthentication for sensitive operations.
- [ ] Store sessions securely and avoid client-side storage of sensitive information.

## 11. Code Reviews and Static Analysis:
- [ ] Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security.
- [ ] Use static code analysis tools to identify security vulnerabilities.

## 12. Incident Response Plan:
- [ ] Develop and document an incident response plan.
- [ ] Establish communication and reporting procedures in case of a security incident.
- [ ] Conduct regular security drills and exercises.

## 13. Access Controls:
- [ ] Limit access to production environments and sensitive data.
- [ ] Regularly review and update access controls based on personnel changes.
- [ ] Enforce the principle of least privilege.

## 14. API Security:
- [ ] Use API keys or tokens for authentication.
- [ ] Implement proper rate limiting and throttling.
- [ ] Validate and sanitize input for API requests.

## 15. Infrastructure Security:
- [ ] Secure server configurations and follow security best practices.
- [ ] Regularly update and patch server software and operating systems.
- [ ] Implement network security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

## 16. Documentation:
- [ ] Maintain up-to-date security documentation, including configurations and procedures.
- [ ] Educate team members about security best practices and procedures.

## 17. Legal and Compliance:
- [ ] Comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.
- [ ] Regularly assess and address legal and compliance requirements.

## 18. Continuous Improvement:
- [ ] Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices.
- [ ] Continuously update and improve security measures based on the evolving threat landscape.
