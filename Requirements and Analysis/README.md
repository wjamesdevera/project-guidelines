# Requirements Analysis Guide and Checklist

## Introduction

Requirements analysis is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle where the project team collaborates with stakeholders to gather, document, and validate project requirements. A thorough analysis ensures a clear understanding of the project scope and objectives.

## Steps for Requirements Analysis

### 1. **Identify Stakeholders:**
   - List and identify all stakeholders involved in the project, including end-users, clients, and team members.

### 2. **Conduct Stakeholder Meetings:**
   - Schedule meetings with stakeholders to understand their needs, expectations, and concerns.
   - Encourage open communication to capture valuable insights.

### 3. **Document User Stories or Use Cases:**
   - Create user stories or use cases to describe the interactions between users and the system.
   - Include scenarios, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria.

### 4. **Gather Functional Requirements:**
   - Identify and document specific functionalities the system must perform.
   - Prioritize requirements based on importance and relevance.

### 5. **Capture Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Document non-functional requirements, including performance, security, usability, and scalability criteria.
   - Ensure requirements are measurable and testable.

### 6. **Define System Constraints:**
   - Identify any constraints that may impact the project, such as budget, time, or technology limitations.
   - Communicate constraints clearly to all stakeholders.

### 7. **Create Requirement Traceability Matrix:**
   - Develop a matrix that traces each requirement back to its source and forward to related design, development, and testing activities.

### 8. **Prioritize Requirements:**
   - Work with stakeholders to prioritize requirements based on business value and project goals.
   - Establish a clear hierarchy to guide development efforts.

### 9. **Verify and Validate Requirements:**
   - Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   - Validate requirements by confirming they align with the overall project objectives.

### 10. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Be open to feedback and make necessary iterations to the requirements document.
   - Refine requirements based on evolving project needs.
